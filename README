GpsFu
=====
This is a Location Based Services API for Ruby and for Ruby on Rails. It currently
supports translation of MyGPSId address_ids into geocoded data. Queries will return 
Hpricot documents that you can use to find address elements in the return packet. 
You can also pass those Hpricot documents to a Location object and use it instead. 

Example
=======
To turn an address id of "pete@work" into a geo-approximate location packet, do the following: 

@hpricot_doc = GPSFu::MyGPSId::Client.id_to_geocode("pete@work", :api_key=>"mykey")

# now you can find out approximately where I am: 
puts (@hpricot_doc.xml/"address/city").inner_html # "Bethesda"
puts (@hpricot_doc.xml/"address/country-code").inner_html # "US"

Or, if you'd rather not parse the Hpricot document, you can use the included Location class:

@loc = Location.new(GPSFu::MyGPSId::Client.id_to_geocode("pete@work", :api_key=>"mykey"))

puts @loc.city
puts @loc.country_code
puts @loc.lat # latitude
puts @loc.lng # longitude
puts @loc.postal_code
puts @loc.postal_district
puts @loc.state
